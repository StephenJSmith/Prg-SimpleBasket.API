You should make the final project available by uploading your project to github or an open code repo (best practice during application is to keep the URL private).

 

Please send us the URL pointing to your repo alongwith the required access details (or failing that zip up the file & I'll fwd to the client).

 

Here are the details:

You need to write a JavaScript application using any front end framework of your choice.

 

The application needs to display a list of products to the user. The user has the ability to add these items to a virtual basket and have the front end update.

 

The products will need to be retrieved from a web API call to a C# back end. A static list of products is fine.

 

Once the products are added to the basket the user will have access to a 'go to basket' button to perform a check out of the products.

 

The checkout page will present the basket items to the user. The user can remove items from the basket here.

 

The checkout page will call a C# backend to calculate the total shipping cost. $10 shipping cost for orders less of $50 dollars and less. $20 for orders more than $50.

 

The checkout page will have a place order button which will post all the products to a C# method and will return success to the page. Once that is complete the page will navigate to a 'thank you' page.

 

The focus of the exercise is on the  C# and JavaScript code only. The pages should be neat but the focus is not the design.
